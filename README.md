# tipCalculator

I know you have seen thousands of tip calculators but this app was my first app where I created without any tutorials so I am pretty proud 
of it. 

How the application works:
1. You enter your total bill amount
2. From the drop down box you choose the percentage of tip amount
3. Enter the amount of people the total amount is being divided by
4. After you click the button 'calculate', as a result you get the amount each person should tip
